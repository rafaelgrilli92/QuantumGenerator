# Quantum Generator
Using a 3rd Part API, this project could generate quantum numbers dynamically.

I used a boilerplate which I've had done, but I needed to change somethings.
I prefer to use a boilerplate because the start configuration always is quite similar and could take sometime to do it starting from zero.

## Getting Started
Install the NPM Packages
```
$ npm install
```

## Running
The default port which the project is running is :3000
```
$ npm start
```

## Built With
